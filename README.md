# WoboStaff

**Summary**

Do you wonder what time is it where your co-workers live?

WoboStaff uses the HipChat API to retrieve the list of the Wobo HipChat users and it will display them grouped by their timezones.

The app also stores a local copy of the data retrieved and it will use it when there is no network connection available.

When launching the app for the first time you will need to enter a valid HipChat API token with scope "View Group", you can create it from your HipChat account settings and just paste it in the app settings panel.
