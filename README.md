# WoboStaff

**Installation**

Rename ConfigSample.plist to Config.plist and add a valid HipChat API Token.

**Summary**

Do you wonder what time is it where your co-workers live?
This app will use the HipChat API to retrieve the list of the Wobo HipChat users and it will display them grouped by their timezones.
The app also stores a local copy of the data retrieved and it will try to use it if there is no network connection available.

<div align="center">
        <img width="45%" height="640px" src="/../screenshots/sc1.jpg" alt="Sc1.jpg"</img>
        <img height="0" width="10px">
        <img width="45%" height="640px" src="/../screenshots/sc2.jpg" alt="Sc2.jpg"</img>
</div>


**ToDo List**

1) Add more users information (eg. online status, title) (DONE)

2) Improved UI (colors, padding) (DONE)

3) Store a cached copy of the images (DONE)

4) Search field to filter the list of users (DONE)

5) When clicking on a specific user, open a new screen with more details (maybe allow to send a message)

6) Add a setting tab to add/update the API token from the app (at that point, this could be reworked into a generic HipChat app)
